Title: Machine-Learning Based Classification of Crime in Los Angeles

Los Angeles, widely considered one of the most dangerous cities in California, experiences a wide range of different crimes. This analysis aims to classify the type of crimes using determinants like date, time, area, and victim demographics. The objective of this research is to facilitate a deeper understanding of crime patterns in the city, enabling more informed resource allocation by law enforcement to improve public safety.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle but originally retrieved from the Open Data repository maintained by the City of Los Angeles. It encompasses manually-transcribed crime reports spanning from January 2010 to April 2023.

NOTE: The original GitHub repository had to be deleted and replaced due to issues concerning file upload size.
